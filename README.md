Intetion to smoth deep learning implementation with geoespatial data

The workflow is:
1. Download tiff images  
2. Create Pytorch Dataset
3. Transferlearning
4. Train/Test with Pytorch
5. Register every iteration in tensorboard

## TODOs

#Comment codes properly  
#transate variable names to english
#Configure paths to work in anywhere
#Example jupyter notebooks with hyperspectral handling
#rename variables in english  
#Example in a jupyter notebook how to work with one 1 band raster  
#Example jupyter notebooks with hyperspectral handling and transfer learning 
#Ensemble models with images from different bands with different resolutions  
#Create a free QGIS plugin for semi-supervisionade DL s2  
#~Example how to work with one 1 band raster~  
#~Code hyperspectral handling~  
#~Code transfer learning with hyperspectral handling~
